# Othello Game

## Description

This project, inspired by the [end-of-year work](https://github.com/Rdrg974/holbertonschool-portfolio) of [Rodrigue Hassany Mohamed](https://github.com/Rdrg974) and [ThÃ©o Jennat](https://github.com/tjennat) at Holberton School, is a browser-based implementation of the classic Othello (also known as Reversi) board game.

The game is designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing black or white discs on the board, flipping the opponent's discs by surrounding them in a straight line. The game continues until neither player can make a valid move, and the player with the most discs on the board wins.

## Objectives

- Render a dynamic game board with valid moves highlighted.
- Implement core game mechanics (player turns, disc placement, and flipping).
- Allow users to restart the game, track scores, and determine the winner.
- Develop a simple algorithm for solo gameplay against the computer.
- Strengthen HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a complete interactive game.
