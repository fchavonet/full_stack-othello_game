## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Othello (also known as Reversi) board game. The game is designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Players take turns placing black or white pieces on the board, flipping the opponent's pieces by surrounding them in a straight line. The game continues until neither player can make a valid move, and the player with the most pieces on the board wins.

Please note that, for now, the game is only playable in a local two-player mode, where players take turns on the same device.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The primary goal of this project is to create a playable version of Othello with a functional UI and game logic. The focus is on:

- Implementing the core game mechanics (player turns, piece placement, and flipping).
- Rendering a dynamic game board with valid moves highlighted.
- Allowing users to restart the game, track scores, and determine the winner.
- Enhancing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building a complete interactive game.
